### Time-Series and Time-Series Survival Analysis methods

| Method | Description | Reference |
|--- | --- | --- |
| **timegan** | TimeGAN is a framework for generating realistic time-series data that combines the flexibility of the unsupervised paradigm with the control afforded by supervised training. Through a learned embedding space jointly optimized with both supervised and adversarial objectives, the network adheres to the dynamics of the training data during sampling.  | [Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.pdf) |
| **fflows** |  FFlows is an explicit likelihood model based on a novel class of normalizing flows that view time-series data in the frequency-domain rather than the time-domain. The method uses a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to convert variable-length time-series with arbitrary sampling periods into fixed-length spectral representations, then applies a (data-dependent) spectral filter to the frequency-transformed time-series.  | [Generative Time-series Modeling with Fourier Flows](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PpshD0AXfA) |
| **probabilistic_ar** | Probabilistic AutoRegressive model allows learning multi-type, multivariate timeseries data and later on generate new synthetic data that has the same format and properties as the learned one. | [PAR model](https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/timeseries/par.html#what-is-par) |


### Privacy & Fairness

| Method | Description | Reference |
|--- | --- | --- |
|**decaf** | Machine learning models have been criticized for reflecting unfair biases in the training data. Instead of solving this by introducing fair learning algorithms directly, DEACF focuses on generating fair synthetic data, such that any downstream learner is fair. Generating fair synthetic data from unfair data - while remaining truthful to the underlying data-generating process (DGP) - is non-trivial. DECAF is a GAN-based fair synthetic data generator for tabular data. With DECAF, we embed the DGP explicitly as a structural causal model in the input layers of the generator, allowing each variable to be reconstructed conditioned on its causal parents. This procedure enables inference time debiasing, where biased edges can be strategically removed to satisfy user-defined fairness requirements.   | [DECAF: Generating Fair Synthetic Data Using Causally-Aware Generative Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12884) |

|**adsgan**| A conditional GAN framework that generates synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient|  [Anonymization Through Data Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks (ADS-GAN)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32167919/) |
|**pategan**| The methos uses the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs, allowing to tightly bound the influence of any individual sample on the model, resulting in tight differential privacy guarantees and thus an improved performance over models with the same guarantees.|  [PATE-GAN: Generating Synthetic Data with Differential Privacy Guarantees](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1zk9iRqF7) |


### Domain adaptation

| Method | Description | Reference |
|--- | --- | --- |
|**radialgan** | Training complex machine learning models for prediction often requires a large amount of data that is not always readily available. Leveraging these external datasets from related but different sources is, therefore, an essential task if good predictive models are to be built for deployment in settings where data can be rare. RadialGAN is an approach to the problem in which multiple GAN architectures are used to learn to translate from one dataset to another, thereby allowing to augment the target dataset effectively and learning better predictive models than just the target dataset. | [RadialGAN: Leveraging multiple datasets to improve target-specific predictive models using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06403) |


### Debug methods

| Method | Description | Reference |
