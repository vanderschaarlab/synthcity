The method uses a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to convert variable-length time-series with arbitrary sampling periods into fixed-length spectral representations, then applies a (data-dependent) spectral filter to the frequency-transformed time-series.  | [Generative Time-series Modeling with Fourier Flows](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PpshD0AXfA) |


### Privacy & Fairness

| Method | Description | Reference |
|--- | --- | --- |
|**decaf** | Machine learning models have been criticized for reflecting unfair biases in the training data. Instead of solving this by introducing fair learning algorithms directly, DEACF focuses on generating fair synthetic data, such that any downstream learner is fair. Generating fair synthetic data from unfair data - while remaining truthful to the underlying data-generating process (DGP) - is non-trivial. DECAF is a GAN-based fair synthetic data generator for tabular data. With DECAF, we embed the DGP explicitly as a structural causal model in the input layers of the generator, allowing each variable to be reconstructed conditioned on its causal parents. This procedure enables inference time debiasing, where biased edges can be strategically removed to satisfy user-defined fairness requirements.   | [DECAF: Generating Fair Synthetic Data Using Causally-Aware Generative Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12884) |

|**dpgan** | Differentially Private GAN | [Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06739) |
|**adsgan**| A conditional GAN framework that generates synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient|  [Anonymization Through Data Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks (ADS-GAN)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32167919/) |
|**pategan**| The methos uses the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs, allowing to tightly bound the influence of any individual sample on the model, resulting in tight differential privacy guarantees and thus an improved performance over models with the same guarantees.|  [PATE-GAN: Generating Synthetic Data with Differential Privacy Guarantees](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1zk9iRqF7) |


### Domain adaptation

| Method | Description | Reference |
|--- | --- | --- |
|**radialgan** | Training complex machine learning models for prediction often requires a large amount of data that is not always readily available. Leveraging these external datasets from related but different sources is, therefore, an essential task if good predictive models are to be built for deployment in settings where data can be rare. RadialGAN is an approach to the problem in which multiple GAN architectures are used to learn to translate from one dataset to another, thereby allowing to augment the target dataset effectively and learning better predictive models than just the target dataset. | [RadialGAN: Leveraging multiple datasets to improve target-specific predictive models using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06403) |

### Images

# Contributing to Synthcity

We want to make contributing to Synthcity is as easy and transparent as possible. We hope to collaborate with as many people as we can.


## Development installation

First create a new environment. It is recommended that you use conda. This can be done as follows:
```bash
conda create -n your-synthcity-env python=3.9
conda activate your-synthcity-env
```
*Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10 are all compatible, but it is best to use the most up to date version you can, as some models may not support older python versions.*

To get the development installation with all the necessary dependencies for
linting, testing, auto-formatting, and pre-commit etc. run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity.git
cd synthcity
pip install -e .[testing]
```

Please check that the pre-commit is properly installed for the repository, by running:
```bash
pre-commit run --all
```
This checks that you are set up properly to contribute, such that you will match the code style in the rest of the project. This is covered in more detail below.


## Our Development Process

### Code Style

We believe that having a consistent code style is incredibly important. Therefore Synthcity imposes certain rules on the code that is contributed and the automated tests will not pass, if the style is not adhered to. These tests passing is a requirement for a contribution being merged. However, we make adhering to this code style as simple as possible. First, all the libraries required to produce code that is compatible with Synthcity's Code Style are installed in the step above when you set up the development environment. Secondly, these libraries are all triggered by pre-commit, so once you are set-up, you don't need to do anything. When you run `git commit`, any simple changes to enforce the style will run automatically and other required changes are explained in the stdout for you to go through and fix.

Synthcity uses the [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) and [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) code formatter to enforce a common code style across the code base. No additional configuration should be needed (see the [black documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation_and_usage.html#usage) for advanced usage).

Also, Synthcity uses [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) to sort imports alphabetically and separate into sections.


#### Type Hints

Synthcity is fully typed using python 3.7+ [type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/). This is enforced for contributions by [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy), which is a static type-checker.


#### Tests

To run the tests, you can either use `pytest` (again, installed with the testing extra above).
The following testing command is good for checking your code,as it skips the tests that take a long time to run.
```bash
pytest -vvvsx -m "not slow" --durations=50
```

But the full test suite can be run with the following command.
```bash
pytest -vvvs  --durations=50
```

Some plugins may be included in the library as extras, the associated tests for these need to be run separately, e.g. the goggle plugin can be tested with the below command:
```bash
pytest -vvvs -k goggle --durations=50
```
## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add tests in the same style as those already present in the repo.
3. If you have changed APIs, document the API change in the PR.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code passes the pre-commit, this will be required in order to commit and push, if you have properly installed pre-commit, which is included in the testing extra.
